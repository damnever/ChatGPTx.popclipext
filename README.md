# A [PopClip](https://pilotmoon.com/popclip/) Extension Powered by ChatGPT

Features:
- Chat with ChatGPT using any text you have selected.
    - Per application chat histories (the chat histories are only kept for contextual use and are currently hidden).
    - The histories will expire automatically if there is no interaction with the application for 8 minutes. Click while holding the shift (⇧) key to force clear the history.
- Opinioned actions:
    - Revising texts with reasons.
    - Polishing texts and correcting the grammar.
    - Translating texts.
    - Summarizing texts.
    - The above functions will use the primary language by default, click while holding the shift (⇧) key to use the secondary languages.
- Any API that is compatible with [the OpenAI chat completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create) is supported.
    - Special support for [the Microsoft Azure OpenAI service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference#chat-completions).
        - Base URL format: `https://{resource-name}.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/{deployment-id}`

This extension will attempt to paste(append) the result directly into the active application if the paste command is available. If not, it will copy the result and provide a preview(with possible truncation due to the limitation of PopClip).


**NOTE:** at the moment, no additional AI services or opinioned actions will be added as there are already too many, making the settings UI too crowded.
